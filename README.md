# BigData-SQL

As an assignment for my Intro to Big Data class, we were asked to do a few tasks. The main point of this assignment was furthering our ability to use postgresql in a coding environment as well as practice our advanced sql quering abilities.

All written portions of the assignment can be found in the report pdf while the coding portions can be found both as the App.zip file and as raw files in the repository.

I am unsure if I am allowed to post the questions, but I am assuming I am not. So, you can speculate what the questions may have been from my work. Additionally, I am not sure if I can give the dataset as well, but I can say that the data came from the askUbuntu web service.
